                I like working with computers. It's my hobby and my profession. I love the Internet and the way it works, and I am comfortable working on web applications; frontend and backend. I've worked on smartphone apps, both native and hybrid, and I have experience with Linux system administration. I have a keen interest in securing information systems and building secure systems.
