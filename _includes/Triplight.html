                "Triplight" is a Sokoban-styled puzzle game I developed in UIUC Gamebuilders. Players navigate through complex levels while pushing lasers that can harm the player and open gates, alongside interactions with mirrors, portals, and other obstacles. The project involved meticulous planning and creative problem-solving to ensure each level presented a unique and challenging puzzle, while still being solveable for the player at the time they try it.
